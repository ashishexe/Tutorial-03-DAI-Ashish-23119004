1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Loaded and inspected the dataset for structure, types, and statistics.

2. **Visualizations:**
   - Created bar plots and box plots to explore `tips` by `day`, `smoker`, and `sex`.
   - Used scatter plots to examine the relationship between `total_bill` and `tip`.

3. **Preprocessing:**
   - Split data into training and validation sets (80/20).
   - Applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables.

4. **Modeling:**
   - Evaluated several regression models:
     - **Linear Regression:** MSE ≈ 0.89, R² ≈ 0.48.
     - **Ridge and Lasso:** Similar performance to Linear Regression.
     - **Decision Tree:** MSE ≈ 0.81, R² ≈ 0.53.
     - **Random Forest:** Best performance with MSE ≈ 0.68, R² ≈ 0.60.
     - **SVM and KNN:** Slightly worse performance compared to Tree-based models.

5. **Feature Importance:**
   - Analyzed feature contributions using tree-based models and mutual information; `total_bill` was the most informative feature.

6. **Visual Diagnostics:**
   - Plotted scatter plots and correlation matrices to visualize relationships.
   - Conducted the Rainbow test for linearity and assessed residual plots for model evaluation.
